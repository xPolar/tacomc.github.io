# ðŸŒ® TacoMC Rules
By playing on TacoMC, you agree to the following rules. If you notice that someone is breaking any of the below rules, it is your responsibility to report it to the proper staff. If there are no staff online, contact one on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/9NG9eGyeVh).

### Modified client
* Use of [Badlion](https://client.badlion.net/) client (or any similar clients such as [Lunar](https://www.lunarclient.com/)), [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home), and some mods such as [VoxelMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/voxelmap), [Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap), and [JourneyMap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/journeymap) (along with other minimap mods that do not disclose underground blocks) is allowed.
* Use of utility clients is bannable (no [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/), [Aristois](https://aristois.net/), etc).
* Some mods, such as [Tweakaroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo), are bannable if used on the server.

### Toxic behavior
* Treat everyone with respect.
* Do not bully anyone.
* Cursing is allowed, so long as it is not directed towards any particular person or figure.

### Griefing
* Breaking blocks that you did not place, even in unclaimed lands, is bannable. This includes spawners that are not naturally generated.
* It is your responsibility to claim your builds. If your builds are griefed, the griefer will be punished, but your builds will not be rolled back to their previous state.
* Creating lava casts, also frequently referred to as "cobble monsters," counts as griefing and is bannable.
* Creating teleport traps, including those intended to kill players, is bannable.
  
### Scamming
* Offering to sell a specific item and instead selling another after a transaction has been made is bannable.
* Selling deceptive shulkers, i.e. shulkers that display the name of a desirable item in the lore but are instead renamed items of a different type, falls under scamming.
* Logging off after a trade agreement has been made falls under scamming.

### Auction House
* Selling renamed items on auction with the purpose of advertising warps, trades and services is not allowed.

### Stealing
* Betrayal of trust on claims falls under this category and will result in a ban.
* Keeping weapons obtained with McMMO disarm during combat is considered stealing.

### Chat, spam, and advertising
* It is okay to mention well-known servers and services in the chat, but advertising a private or malicious server or service is bannable.
* Chat spam of any kind, including command spam and splitting a word in multiple smaller messages, will result in a (temporary) mute. 
* It is not okay to discuss politics in public chat. By extension, it is also not okay to disrespect others based on their political or religious views.
* Use only English in main chat. You are allowed to use other languages in private messages, such as /msg or party chat.
* Excessive use of capitalization is not allowed. Repeated offenses will result in a (temporary) mute. 
* Announcing that a staff member is vanished is not allowed. 

### Racism, offensive language, and discrimination
* Do not use racist, offensive, or discriminatory language in chat, on signs, in books, in item names, private messages, or anywhere on the server that accepts text.
* This includes the use of the n-word, hate symbols, or hate speech.
* We are strict about this and will permanently ban if this occurs.

### Exploiting server issues
* If you discover a server bug, **do not** exploit it for your own gain. Report this issue directly to an administrator.
* Irresponsible disclosure of bugs, such as in public chat or the Discord server, will result in a permanent ban.

### Spreading misinformation/defamation
* Intentionally spreading misinformation to hurt the image of the server or any of its staff or players is strictly bannable.
* Defamation will not be tolerated.
* Issuing false player reports is bannable.

### Alternate account usage (Alts)
* Using alternate accounts to bypass bans will result in a permanent IP ban.

### Threats
* Threatening to damage any part of the server, including its players, is strictly prohibited and will result in a ban.
* Threatening to attack the server, i.e. DDoS attack, is bannable.
* Encouraging other players to break the rules is bannable.
* Building lag machines or machines that are intentionally created to degrade the server performance count as an attack.
  
### Drama and discussing punishments 
* Starting drama or encouraging others to start drama on the server is strictly bannable.

### Inappropriate skins and names
* Any skin or username that is deemed inappropriate by the staff will result in a ban until it is changed. 
* This also goes for item names in-game.

### Scope of moderation
* Staff have final say when it comes to punishments and moderation. Listen to what they tell you.
* We do **not** moderate anything that takes place outside of the bounds of our server. We only moderate actions on the TacoMC server or within the TacoMC Discord server. Anything outside of that is out of our scope of moderation, and you are responsible for moderating yourself.
* As soon as a conversation moves to private messages outside of the server (DMs), we cannot moderate what happens. If the conversation is between a player and TacoMC Staff, any threats or messages intended to harm may result in punishment. This is for both the staff member and the player.
* The job of moderators is to moderate and enforce the rules. They are not necessarily here to help you with gameplay, such as assisting with your builds. Do not waste their time.

### Store purchases
* All store purchases are final. Chargebacks will result in a permanent ban.
* We do not offer refunds on purchases made unless you do not receive the advertised goods.

### Disclaimer
* TacoMC ("us", "we", or "our") reserves the right to change these Rules at any time, at its sole discretion, without notice. Any change binds you as soon as you access the https://map.tacomc.xyz (the "Site"), the TacoMC Minecraft server (the "Server"), and the TacoMC Discord server (the "Discord Server"). We therefore strongly recommend checking the Rules on a regular basis.
